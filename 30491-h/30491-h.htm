<h2>By Charles V. De Vet</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Now watch</span>," Remm said, indicating
the native. Macker had
been absent, exploring the countryside
in the immediate vicinity of
their landing place, and had not
witnessed the capture of the native,
or the tests his two companions
made on it.</p>

<p>Macker followed Remm's gaze to
where the biped native sat hunched.
The creature was bent into an ungainly
position, its body crooked at
incongruous angles, in such a way
as to allow most of its weight to
rest on a packing-box at the base
of a middle angle. Its stubby feet,
on the ends of thin, pipelike legs,
rested against the floor of the space
ship. Its body was covered, almost
entirely, with an artificial skin material
of various colors. Some of the
colors hurt Macker's eyes. In the
few places where the flesh showed
through the skin was an unhealthy,
pallid white.</p>

<p>Slowly the creature's head swiveled
on its short neck until it faced
them.</p>

<p>"Those orifices in the upper portion
of its skull are evidently organs
of sight," Remm said. "It sees that
we are quite a distance away. It
will probably attempt to escape
again."</p>

<p>Slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;the native's
head rotated away from them in a
half-circle until it faced Toolls,
working over his instruments on the
far side of the room. Then it turned
its head back until it faced the door
of the ship.</p>

<p>"It is setting itself for flight
now," Remm said. "Notice the evidence
of strain on its face."</p>

<p>The creature leaned forward and
the appendages on the ends of its
upper limbs clutched the sides of
the box as it propelled its body forward.</p>

<p>It raised its right foot in a slow
arc, employing a double-jointed,
breaking action of its leg. For a
long moment it rested its entire
weight on its lumpy right foot,
while its momentum carried its
body sluggishly forward. Then it repeated
the motion with its left leg;
then again its right. All the while
evidencing great exertion and concentration
of effort.</p>

<p>"It is making what it considers a
mad dash for freedom," Remm
said. "Probably at the ultimate
speed of which it is capable. That
would be ridiculous except that it's
normal for its own environment.
This is definitely a slow-motion
world."</p>

<p>The creature was a third-way to
the door now. Once again its head
turned in its slow quarter-circle, to
look at them. As it saw that Remm
and Macker had not moved it altered
the expression on its face.</p>

<p>"It seems to express its emotions
through facial contortions," Remm
said. "Though I suspect that the
sounds it makes with the upper part
of its trachea during moments of
agitation are also outlets of emotional
stress, rather than efforts at
communication." He called across
the room to Toolls. "What did you
find out about its speech?"</p>

<p>"Extremely primitive," Toolls replied.
"Incredible as it may appear
to us it uses combinations of
sounds to form word-symbols. Each
word indicates some action, or object;
or denotes degree, time, or
shades of meaning. Other words are
merely connectives. It seems to
make little use of inflections, the
basis of a rational language.
Thoughts which we can project
with a few sounds would take it
dozens of words to express."</p>

<p>"Just how intelligent is it?"
Macker asked.</p>

<p>"Only as intelligent as a high degree
of self-preservation instinct
would make it."</p>

<p>"Are you certain that it is a member
of the dominant species of life
on the planet?"</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it,"
Toolls replied. "I've made very
careful observations."</p>

<p>"This attempt at escape is a pretty
good example of its intelligence,"
Remm said. "This is the sixth time
it has tried to escape&mdash;in exactly
the same way. As soon as it sees
that we are farther away from it
than it is from the door, it makes its
dash."</p>

<hr />

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="359" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<i><small><b>It was an arm to be proud of&mdash;but what good was it?</b></small></i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The creature</span> was one step
away from the space ship's open
portal now and bringing its foot up
to cross the threshold. Remm
walked over and lifted it off the
floor.</p>

<p>"Its legs are still moving in a
running motion," Macker said.
"Doesn't it realize yet that you've
picked it up?"</p>

<p>"Its nervous system and reflexes
are evidently as slow as its motor
muscles," Remm replied. "There
has not been time for the sensation
of my picking it up to reach the
brain, and for the brain to send
back its message to the legs to stop
their running motion."</p>

<p>"How heavy is it?" Macker
asked.</p>

<p>"Only a few ounces," Remm replied.
"But that's logical considering
that this is a 'light' planet. If
we took it back to our own 'heavy'
world, gravity would crush it to a
light film of the liquid which comprises
the greater part of its substance."</p>

<p>Remm set the creature down on
the box in its former queerly contorted
position. Toolls had left his
instruments and strolled over beside
them to observe the native.</p>

<p>"One of its appendages seems
bent at a peculiar angle," Macker
said.</p>

<p>"I noticed that," Remm answered.
"I think that I may have
broken the bone in several places
when I first captured it. I was not
aware then of how fragile it was.
But now that you mention it, I
should be able to use that injury
to give you a good illustration of
the interplay of emotional expressions
on its face. Observe now as I
touch it."</p>

<p>Remm reached over and touched&mdash;very
lightly&mdash;the broken portion
of the native's appendage. The
muscles of the creature's face pulled
its flaccid flesh into distorted positions,
bunching some and stretching
others. "It is very probably registering
pain," Remm said.</p>

<p>Suddenly the starch seemed to
leave the native's body and it slowly
slumped across the packing-box.</p>

<p>"Why is it doing that, Toolls?"
Remm asked.</p>

<p>Toolls concentrated for a minute,
absorbing the feelings and
thought pulsations emanating from
the creature. "The conscious plane
of its mind has blanked out," he
said. "I presume the pain you
caused by touching its wounded
member resulted in a breakdown
of its nervous system. The only
thought waves I receive now are
disjointed impressions and pictures
following no rational series. However,
I'm certain that it will be
only temporary."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that in justice
to the creature we should repair its
wound before we free it?" Macker
asked.</p>

<p>"I had intended to have it done,"
Remm replied. "You shouldn't
have any trouble fixing it, should
you, Toolls?"</p>

<p>"No," Toolls answered. "I may
as well attend to it right now." He
rolled the portable <i>converter</i> over
beside the creature and carefully
laid its arm in the "pan." The <i>converter</i>
automatically set its gauges
and instruments of calculation, and
gave its click of "ready."</p>

<p>Toolls fed a short length of <i>basic</i>
into the machine and it began its
work. The native was still unconscious.</p>

<p>The bone of the wounded arm
slowly evaporated, beginning with
the wrist joint. The evaporated
portion was instantly replaced by
the manufactured bone of the <i>converter</i>.
At the same time it repaired
all ruptured blood vessels and damaged
ligaments and muscles.</p>

<p>"It was not possible, of course,
for me to replace the bone with another
of the same composition as
its own," Toolls said, after the machine
had completed its work. "But
I gave it one of our 'heavy' ones.
There will be no force on this
planet powerful enough to break it
again."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The native's</span> first evidence of
a return to consciousness was a
faint fluttering of the lids that covered
its organs of vision. The lids
opened and it looked up at them.</p>

<p>"Its eyesight is as slow as its muscular
reactions," Remm said.
"Watch." Remm raised his hand
and waved it slowly in front of the
native's face. The eyes of the native,
moving in odd, jerking movements,
followed the hand's progress.
Remm raised the hand&mdash;speeding
its action slightly&mdash;and the eyesight
faltered and lost it. The native's
eyes rolled wildly until once
again they located the hand.</p>

<p>Remm took three steps forward.
The native's eyes were unable to
follow his change of position. Its
gaze wandered about the room, until
again its settled on Remm's waiting
figure.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine anything being
so slow," Remm said, "and
still ..." Suddenly Macker interrupted.
"Something is wrong. It is
trying to get up, but it can't." The
native was registering signs of distress,
kicking its legs and twisting its
body into new positions of contortion.</p>

<p>"I see what the trouble is," Toolls
said. "It's unable to lift the appendage
with the new bone in. I never
thought of that before but its
'light' muscles aren't strong
enough to lift the limb. We've got
the poor creature pinned to the box
by the weight of its own arm."</p>

<p>"We can't do that to it," Remm
said. "Isn't there any way you can
give it a lighter bone?"</p>

<p>"None that wouldn't take a retooling
of the <i>converter</i>," Toolls
said. "I'm not certain that I could
do it, and even if I could, we don't
have the time to spare. I could give
it stronger muscles in the arm, but
that may throw off the metabolism
of the whole body. If it did, the result
would be fatal. I'd hate to
chance it."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," Macker said.
By the inflections of his tones the
others knew that some incongruity
of the situation had aroused Macker's
sense of humor. "Why don't
we give the creature an entirely
new body? We could replace the
flesh and viscera, as well as the
cartilaginous structure, with our
own type substance. It would probably
be an indestructible being as
far as its own world is concerned.
And it would be as powerful as
their mightiest machines. We'd
leave behind us a superman that
could change the course of this
world's history. You could do it,
couldn't you, Toolls?"</p>

<p>"Quite simply."</p>

<p>"Our policy has always been not
to interfere in anyway with the
races we study," Remm protested.</p>

<p>"But our policy has also been
never to harm any of them, if at
all possible to avoid it," Macker insisted.
"In common justice you
have to complete the job Toolls began
on the arm, or you're condemning
this poor thing to death."</p>

<p>"But do we have the right to
loose such an unpredictable factor
as it would be among them?"
Remm asked. "After all, our purpose
is exploration and observation,
not playing the parts of gods to the
primitives we encounter."</p>

<p>"True, that is the rule which we
have always followed in the past,"
Macker agreed, "but it is in no way
a requirement. We are empowered
to use our judgment in all circumstances.
And in this particular instance
I believe I can convince you
that the course I suggest is the more
just one." He turned to Toolls.
"Just what stage of cultural development
would you say this creature's
race has attained?"</p>

<p>"It still retains more of an animal-like
adaptation to its surroundings
than an intellectual one,"
Toolls replied. "Its civilization is
divided into various sized units of
cooperation which it calls governments.
Each unit vies with the
others for a greater share of its
world's goods. That same rivalry is
carried down to the individual
within the unit. Each strives for acquisition
against his neighbor.</p>

<p>"Further they retain many of
their tribal instincts, such as gregariousness,
emotional rather than
intellectual propagation, and worship
of the mightiest fighter. This
last, however, is manifested by reverence
for individuals attaining position
of authority, or acquiring
large amounts of their medium of
exchange, rather than by physical
superiority."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," Macker
said. "Our policy in the past has
been to avoid tampering, only because
of the fear of bringing harm.
If we created a super being among
them, to act as a controlling and
harmonizing force, we'd hasten
their development by thousands of
years. We'd be granting them the
greatest possible boon!"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Remm said, obviously
swayed by Macker's logic.
"I'm still hesitant about introducing
a being into their midst whose
thought processes would be so subtle
and superior to their own. How
do you feel about it, Toolls?"</p>

<p>"What would they have to lose?"
Toolls asked with his penchant for
striking the core of an argument.</p>

<p>"The right or wrong of such
moral and philosophical considerations
has always been a delicate
thing to decide," Remm acquiesced
reluctantly. "Go ahead if you think
it is the right thing to do."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"All finished</span>?" Macker asked.</p>

<p>"That depends on how much
you want me to do," Toolls replied.
"I've substituted our 'heavy'
substances for his entire body structure,
including the brain&mdash;at the
same time transferring his former
memory and habit impressions.
That was necessary if he is to be
able to care for himself. Also I
brought his muscular reaction time
up to our norm, and speeded his reflexes."</p>

<p>"Have you implanted any techniques
which he did not possess before,
such as far-seeing, or mental
insight?" Macker asked.</p>

<p>"No," Toolls said. "That is what
I want your advice about. Just how
much should I reveal about ourselves
and our background? Or
should he be left without any
knowledge of us?"</p>

<p>"Well ..." Now that the others
had deferred to Macker's arguments,
he had lost much of his certainty.
"Perhaps we should at least
let him know who we are, and what
we have done. That would save him
much alarm and perplexity when it
comes time to reorient himself. On
the other hand, perhaps we should
go even farther and implant the
knowledge of some of our sciences.
Then he could do a better job of
advancing his people. But maybe
I'm wrong. What do you think
about it, Remm?"</p>

<p>"My personal opinion," Remm
said, "is that we can't give him
much of our science, because it
would be like giving a baby a high
explosive to play with. His race is
much too primitive to handle it
wisely. Either he, or someone to
whom he imparts what we teach
him, would be certain to bring
catastrophe to his world. And if
we let him learn less, but still remember
his contact with us, in time
his race would very likely come to
regard us as gods. I would hesitate
to drag in any metaphysical confusion
to add to the uncertainties
you are already engendering. My
advice would be to wipe his mind
of all memory of us. Let him explain
his new found invincibility to
himself in his own way."</p>

<p>Macker had no criticism to offer
to this suggestion. "Does he retain
any of his immunity to this world's
malignant germs?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They are too impotent to represent
any hazard to his present body
mechanism," Toolls replied. "If and
when he dies, it will not be from
disease."</p>

<p>"He will be subject to the deterioration
of old age, the same as
we are, won't he?" Macker asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," Toolls said, "but
that's the only thing that will be
able to bring him down. He cannot
be harmed by any force this 'light'
world can produce; he is impervious
to sickness; and he will live indefinitely."</p>

<p>"Indefinitely?"</p>

<p>"As his world reckons time.
Their normal life span is less than
a hundred years. Ours is over five
thousand. He will probably live
approximately twice that long, because
he will be subjected to less
stress and strain, living as he does
on a world of lighter elements."</p>

<p>"Then we have truly made a
superman," Macker's tones inflected
satisfaction. "I wish we were
returning this way in a thousand
years or so. I'd like to see the monumental
changes he will effect."</p>

<p>"We may at that," Remm said,
"or others of our people will. He
will probably be a living legend by
then. I'd like to hear what his race
has to say about him. Do they
have names with which to differentiate
individuals?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Toolls said. "This one has
a family designation of Pollnow,
and a member designation of Orville."</p>

<p>"It will be necessary for us to
leave in exactly ten minutes,"
Remm reminded them. "Our next
stopping place&mdash;the red star&mdash;will
reach its nearest conjunction with
this planet by the time we meet it
out in space."</p>

<p>"Then we will have time to do
nothing more for him before we
go," Macker said. "But as far as I
can see we've forgotten nothing,
have we, Toolls?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Toolls answered. "No&mdash;we
forgot nothing."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But Toolls</span> was wrong. They
had forgotten one thing. A
minor detail, relatively....</p>

<p>On Toolls' world his race, in
the course of its evolution, had adjusted
itself to its own particular
environment. Logically, the final result
was that they evolved into
beings best able to survive in that
environment. As such their food&mdash;a
"heavy," highly concentrated food&mdash;was
ideally suited to supply the
needs of their "heavy," tremendously
avid organisms.</p>

<p>Orville Pollnow had no such food
available. His body&mdash;no larger than
before&mdash;had an Earth mass of one
hundred and eighty thousand
pounds. One hundred and eighty
thousand pounds&mdash;the weight of
twelve hundred average sized men&mdash;of
fiercely burning, intense virility.
Even continuous eating&mdash;of his
own world's food&mdash;could not supply
the demands of that body.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours after the
aliens left, Pollnow was dead&mdash;of
starvation.</p>
